## Bayesian Decision Tree
This is an implementation of the Bayesian decision tree paper (TODO: add link) and thus represents
a port of our Java implementation.

There are two versions of the Bayesian decision tree model:
- A pure binary classification version that is intended to be shipped with the paper
- A more elaborate version that allows binary and multi-class classification and also regression
